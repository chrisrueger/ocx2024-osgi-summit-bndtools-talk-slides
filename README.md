# Unlocking the Power of OSGi: The Latest Innovations in Bndtools - @ OXC2024 - OSGi Summit

OSGi is an amazing runtime that can be made very easy to use with the right tooling. In this talk, we explore the latest updates to Bndtools, the primary OSGi development environment, highlighting how these enhancements can streamline the development process. We'll cover the recent improvements in project templates, dependency management, and debugging functionalities, all designed to boost efficiency and reduce common development challenges. Additionally, we introduce an innovative AI-Code Assistant feature, utilizing an AI Assistant to allow you to talk with your code base. An assistant that will make starting much easier for newcomers, provides insights into your codebase, and can perform many core tasks.

This session is perfect for developers already using OSGi and want to know more how Bndtools can simplify their world while increasing the utility of OSGi.
